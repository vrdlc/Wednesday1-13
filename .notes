Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

No README, but there were many commits, all of them descriptive.


Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

Code is easy to read and well indented.

Were branching and looping used effectively?

Yes.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

A little, but very basic.

Is the site user-friendly?

Sites work the way they're supposed to. 

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

I'd say use more CSS to design your webpages, but we didn't use much at all either (and in one case, none...)
